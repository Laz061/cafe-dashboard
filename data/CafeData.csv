It is the ABCs Cafe in Mitre 10, Rotorua. I have never had a Barista tell me that an Americano is one shot .and I would have to pay 80 cents more for a two shot. I could have a Long Black that’s two shots.
My son is a Barista and he tells me that both a Long Black and an Americano are two shots but made differently.
Then this woman at the counter said, my friend could not have an iced coffee, it was not included in the Birthday “bring a friend”. And she could only have a small Flat White! I was embarrassed and disappointed at the treatment given, by this new staff member.
I would not recommend ABCs Mitre 10 at the moment. My experience was not a good one. Kind regards, Phillipa Norman.",21/10/2024 10:47:00 AM,$5.50,4978573,,

Nelson  ,2,"Service and food are great!
However, this is the third time we have been in to the Mitre 10 Mega Nelson Cafe ABCs and been REALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE COFFEE. We are not coffee aficionados And I don’t know what has changed because their coffees used to be one of the best. We used to order flat whites but they became weaker in taste so had decided to order Americanos - they tasted like they had been watered down. Awful, but because we had mentioned the weak coffee last time, we didn’t want to make a fuss this time. Not sure what the problem is, whether the barist has changed or the coffee blend they are using, but certainly lacks the ABCs punch we have come to expect and it has put us off from going as often as we used to.Sorry to say.",24/10/2024 9:31:01 AM,$14.20,4978969,,

Waited another 20 min for new eggs and bacon. That’s it. No apologies. Nothing. Highly disappointed with how it affected our morning. Food was mediocre at best. One coffee was ice cold. The only redeeming factor was the other Americano was perfection. Doubt we would be returning soon after that, when there are other options in close proximity.
